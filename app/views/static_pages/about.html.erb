          Define combat sir. We're stuck on an island with a bunch of violence-for-pleasure-seeking psychopathic marines SHAME-ON-THEM! You know I like history too and maybe when this is all over you and I can stop by the souvenir shop together but right now I just... I just wanna find some rockets! This is pistachio paste isn't it? No but your face is.  Put... the bunny... back... in the box.

          No one is gonna tell me who I can score with! All right but when they attack the car save the radio. Sorry boss but there's only two men I trust. One of them's me. The other's not you. Kill me! Why didn't you just tell them were the microfilm was and create a solution? Well I'm one of those fortunate people who like my job sir. You just put it in the right file according to alphabetical order! Y'know A B C D E F G!
