## OceanClimate

Get the weather by SMS or on the Web App. Text the app with latitude and longitude coordinates (*see note below*) or fill in the form fields.

*Because I use the free version of the Twilio REST API, my phone is the only one registered to text the app. Many apologies*

### Usage and Purpose

I remember reading an article about fishermen in Bangladesh and Eastern Africa communicating by text message. They would let each other know of the weather conditions and choice fishing spots. All by text message.

..* They project uses Twitter OAuth. Simply click on the Login with Twitter button.

### Design Goals

Just a lightweight design that would let me port it to any other app ideas involving SMS. Next project could be a polling service.
